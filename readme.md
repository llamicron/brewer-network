# Set Brewpi Wifi
Our [Brewpi](https://github.com/llamicron/adaptibrew) acts as a WAP, enabling this Flask utility to run. From here we can set wireless network credentials in `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant` to make a connection. Without this tool, we would have to bring a monitor, keyboard, etc. to make a hard connection.
